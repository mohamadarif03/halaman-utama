<p class="has-drop-cap">Good web design has visual weight, is <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="#" target="_blank">optimized for various devices</a>, and has content that is prioritized for the medium. The most important elements of a web page should have more visual weight to <strong>&#8220;naturally attract&#8221;</strong> a visitor’s attention.</p>



<p>Optimization for various types of devices and resolutions plays a fundamental role in modern website design. Web page layouts should be <a href="#" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">genuinely responsive</a> and not rely on any fixed-size elements. Web designers using <a href="#" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fluid grids</a> and flexible images will guarantee that a web page will render well on a variety of devices, windows, and screen sizes.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>Good design is making something intelligible and memorable. Great design is making something memorable and meaningful.</p><cite>Dieter Rams</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>Most users search for something interesting<em> </em>(or useful) and clickable; as soon as some promising candidates are found, users click.<strong> If the new page doesn’t meet users’ expectations,</strong> the back button is clicked and the search process is continued.</p>



<h2>A good website should be easy to navigate</h2>



<p>Not all websites are made equal. Some websites are simple, logical, and easy to use. Others are a messy hodgepodge of pages and links.</p>

<p>Without website navigation, your visitors can’t figure out how to find your blog, your email signup page, your product listings, pricing, contact information, or help docs.</p>

<p><strong>Quick and easy access to the content they’re after is more important for your website users than a… visually-stunning design.</strong></p>



<p>Website navigation allows visitors to flow from one page to another without frustration. If you’ve done your job well, visitors leave your site with the <a href="#" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">intention to return</a> and might even buy something from you or sign up for your email list.</p>



<p><em>Bad navigation is an especially common problem. We’ve all struggled to find things on disorganized websites without any logical structure. It feels hopeless.</em></p>



<p>Using <strong>&#8220;complex large pictures&#8221;</strong>. Because a carousel generally carries a lot of picture messages, complex large pictures result in low performance and <strong>&#8220;slow loading rate&#8221;</strong> of the sites, especially those whose first homepages are occupied by high-resolution carousels.</p>



<h2>Creating visual rhythms in your layouts</h2>



<p>In design, rhythm is created by simply repeating elements in predictable patterns. This repetition is a natural thing that occurs everywhere in our world. As people, we are driven everyday by predictable, timed events.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://foxiz.themeruby.com/tech/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/12/ts2-1024x576.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-1503" /><figcaption>VR is the use of computer technology to create a simulated environment.</figcaption></figure>



<p>One of the best ways to use <a href="#" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">repetition and rhythm in web design</a> is in the site&#8217;s navigation menu. A consistent, easy-to-follow pattern—in color, layout, etc. Gives users an intuitive roadmap to everything you want to share on your site.</p>



<p>Rhythm also factors into the <strong>layout of content</strong>. For example, you <strong>&#8220;might have&#8221;</strong> blog articles, press releases, and events each follow their own certain layout pattern.</p>



<h2>Elements that can help website visual composition</h2>



<p>Nobody enjoys looking at an ugly web page. Garish colors, cluttered images and distracting animation can all turn customers <strong>&#8220;off&#8221;</strong> and send them shopping<strong> &#8220;somewhere else&#8221;</strong>. Basic composition rules to create more effective:</p>



<ul class="rb-list"><li>Direct the Eye With<strong> </strong><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="#" target="_blank">Leading Lines</a></li><li>Balance Out Your Elements</li><li>Use Elements That<strong> Complement Each Other</strong></li><li>Be clear about your <strong>&#8220;focal points&#8221;</strong> and where you place them</li></ul>



<p>The size and position of elements in a composition will determine its balance. An unbalanced design generates tension, which may be the goal in many design projects, but for web apps that demand repeated comfortable use, tension is not a desirable trait.</p>



<h2>Diving into UX and UI design</h2>



<p><strong>UX and UI: </strong>Two terms that are often used interchangeably, but actually mean very different things. <em>So what exactly is the difference?</em></p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote alignright is-style-default"><blockquote><p>Styles come and go. Good design is a language, not a style.</p><cite>Massimo Vignelli</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>UX design refers to the term <em>“user experience design”</em>, while UI stands for <em>“user interface design</em><strong>”</strong>. Both elements are crucial to a product and work closely together. But despite their relationship, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="#" target="_blank">the roles themselves</a> are quite different.</p>



<h2>Ensure that interactive elements are easy to identify</h2>



<p>Good design guides the user by communicating purpose and priority. For that reason, every part of the design should be based on an <strong>&#8220;<strong>informed decision</strong></strong>&#8221; rather than an arbitrary result of personal taste or the current trend.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="683" src="https://foxiz.themeruby.com/tech/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/12/ts1-1024x683.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-1500" /><figcaption>Network firewalls and security technologies</figcaption></figure>



<p>Provide distinct styles for interactive elements, such as <em>links and buttons</em>, to make them easy to identify. For example, <strong>&#8220;change the appearance of links&#8221;</strong> on mouse hover, &#8220;keyboard focus&#8221;, and &#8220;touch-screen activation&#8221;.</p>



<h2>Breaking down the barriers</h2>



<p><strong>Design is not the end-all solution to all of the worlds problems</strong> — but with the right thinking and application, it can definitely be a good beginning to start tackling them.</p>

<p><strong>Quick and easy access to the content they’re after is more important for your website users than a… visually-stunning design.</strong></p>



<p>Website navigation allows visitors to flow from one page to another without frustration. If you’ve done your job well, visitors leave your site with the <a href="#" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">intention to return</a> and might even buy something from you or sign up for your email list.</p>



<p><em>Bad navigation is an especially common problem. We’ve all struggled to find things on disorganized websites without any logical structure. It feels hopeless.</em></p>



<p>Using <strong>&#8220;complex large pictures&#8221;</strong>. Because a carousel generally carries a lot of picture messages, complex large pictures result in low performance and <strong>&#8220;slow loading rate&#8221;</strong> of the sites, especially those whose first homepages are occupied by high-resolution carousels.</p>



<h2>Creating visual rhythms in your layouts</h2>



<p>In design, rhythm is created by simply repeating elements in predictable patterns. This repetition is a natural thing that occurs everywhere in our world. As people, we are driven everyday by predictable, timed events.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://foxiz.themeruby.com/tech/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/12/ts2-1024x576.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-1503" /><figcaption>VR is the use of computer technology to create a simulated environment.</figcaption></figure>



<p>One of the best ways to use <a href="#" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">repetition and rhythm in web design</a> is in the site&#8217;s navigation menu. A consistent, easy-to-follow pattern—in color, layout, etc. Gives users an intuitive roadmap to everything you want to share on your site.</p>



<p>Rhythm also factors into the <strong>layout of content</strong>. For example, you <strong>&#8220;might have&#8221;</strong> blog articles, press releases, and events each follow their own certain layout pattern.</p>



<h2>Elements that can help website visual composition</h2>



<p>Nobody enjoys looking at an ugly web page. Garish colors, cluttered images and distracting animation can all turn customers <strong>&#8220;off&#8221;</strong> and send them shopping<strong> &#8220;somewhere else&#8221;</strong>. Basic composition rules to create more effective:</p>



<ul class="rb-list"><li>Direct the Eye With<strong> </strong><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="#" target="_blank">Leading Lines</a></li><li>Balance Out Your Elements</li><li>Use Elements That<strong> Complement Each Other</strong></li><li>Be clear about your <strong>&#8220;focal points&#8221;</strong> and where you place them</li></ul>



<p>The size and position of elements in a composition will determine its balance. An unbalanced design generates tension, which may be the goal in many design projects, but for web apps that demand repeated comfortable use, tension is not a desirable trait.</p>



<h2>Diving into UX and UI design</h2>



<p><strong>UX and UI: </strong>Two terms that are often used interchangeably, but actually mean very different things. <em>So what exactly is the difference?</em></p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote alignright is-style-default"><blockquote><p>Styles come and go. Good design is a language, not a style.</p><cite>Massimo Vignelli</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>UX design refers to the term <em>“user experience design”</em>, while UI stands for <em>“user interface design</em><strong>”</strong>. Both elements are crucial to a product and work closely together. But despite their relationship, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="#" target="_blank">the roles themselves</a> are quite different.</p>



<h2>Ensure that interactive elements are easy to identify</h2>



<p>Good design guides the user by communicating purpose and priority. For that reason, every part of the design should be based on an <strong>&#8220;<strong>informed decision</strong></strong>&#8221; rather than an arbitrary result of personal taste or the current trend.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="683" src="https://foxiz.themeruby.com/tech/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/12/ts1-1024x683.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-1500" /><figcaption>Network firewalls and security technologies</figcaption></figure>



<p>Provide distinct styles for interactive elements, such as <em>links and buttons</em>, to make them easy to identify. For example, <strong>&#8220;change the appearance of links&#8221;</strong> on mouse hover, &#8220;keyboard focus&#8221;, and &#8220;touch-screen activation&#8221;.</p>



<h2>Breaking down the barriers</h2>



<p><strong>Design is not the end-all solution to all of the worlds problems</strong> — but with the right thinking and application, it can definitely be a good beginning to start tackling them.</p>

<p>Optimization for various types of devices and resolutions plays a fundamental role in modern website design.

<p class="has-drop-cap">Good web design has visual weight, is <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="#" target="_blank">optimized for various devices</a>, and has content that is prioritized for the medium.

<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>Good design is making something intelligible and memorable. Great design is making something memorable and meaningful.</p><cite>Dieter Rams</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>Most users search for something interesting<em> </em>(or useful) and clickable; as soon as some promising candidates are found, users click.<strong> If the new page doesn’t meet users’ expectations,</strong> the back button is clicked and the search process is continued.</p>

<p><strong>Quick and easy access to the content they’re after is more important for your website users than a… visually-stunning design.</strong></p>



<p>Website navigation allows visitors to flow from one page to another without frustration. If you’ve done your job well, visitors leave your site with the <a href="#" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">intention to return</a> and might even buy something from you or sign up for your email list.</p>



<p><em>Bad navigation is an especially common problem. We’ve all struggled to find things on disorganized websites without any logical structure. It feels hopeless.</em></p>



<p>Using <strong>&#8220;complex large pictures&#8221;</strong>. Because a carousel generally carries a lot of picture messages, complex large pictures result in low performance and <strong>&#8220;slow loading rate&#8221;</strong> of the sites, especially those whose first homepages are occupied by high-resolution carousels.</p>



<h2>Creating visual rhythms in your layouts</h2>



<p>In design, rhythm is created by simply repeating elements in predictable patterns. This repetition is a natural thing that occurs everywhere in our world. As people, we are driven everyday by predictable, timed events.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://foxiz.themeruby.com/tech/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/12/ts2-1024x576.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-1503" /><figcaption>VR is the use of computer technology to create a simulated environment.</figcaption></figure>



<p>One of the best ways to use <a href="#" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">repetition and rhythm in web design</a> is in the site&#8217;s navigation menu. A consistent, easy-to-follow pattern—in color, layout, etc. Gives users an intuitive roadmap to everything you want to share on your site.</p>



<p>Rhythm also factors into the <strong>layout of content</strong>. For example, you <strong>&#8220;might have&#8221;</strong> blog articles, press releases, and events each follow their own certain layout pattern.</p>



<h2>Elements that can help website visual composition</h2>



<p>Nobody enjoys looking at an ugly web page. Garish colors, cluttered images and distracting animation can all turn customers <strong>&#8220;off&#8221;</strong> and send them shopping<strong> &#8220;somewhere else&#8221;</strong>. Basic composition rules to create more effective:</p>



<ul class="rb-list"><li>Direct the Eye With<strong> </strong><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="#" target="_blank">Leading Lines</a></li><li>Balance Out Your Elements</li><li>Use Elements That<strong> Complement Each Other</strong></li><li>Be clear about your <strong>&#8220;focal points&#8221;</strong> and where you place them</li></ul>



<p>The size and position of elements in a composition will determine its balance. An unbalanced design generates tension, which may be the goal in many design projects, but for web apps that demand repeated comfortable use, tension is not a desirable trait.</p>



<h2>Diving into UX and UI design</h2>



<p><strong>UX and UI: </strong>Two terms that are often used interchangeably, but actually mean very different things. <em>So what exactly is the difference?</em></p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote alignright is-style-default"><blockquote><p>Styles come and go. Good design is a language, not a style.</p><cite>Massimo Vignelli</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>UX design refers to the term <em>“user experience design”</em>, while UI stands for <em>“user interface design</em><strong>”</strong>.

<p><strong>Quick and easy access to the content they’re after is more important for your website users than a… visually-stunning design.</strong></p>



<p>Website navigation allows visitors to flow from one page to another without frustration. If you’ve done your job well, visitors leave your site with the <a href="#" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">intention to return</a> and might even buy something from you or sign up for your email list.</p>



<p><em>Bad navigation is an especially common problem. We’ve all struggled to find things on disorganized websites without any logical structure. It feels hopeless.</em></p>



<p>Using <strong>&#8220;complex large pictures&#8221;</strong>. Because a carousel generally carries a lot of picture messages, complex large pictures result in low performance and <strong>&#8220;slow loading rate&#8221;</strong> of the sites, especially those whose first homepages are occupied by high-resolution carousels.</p>



<h2>Creating visual rhythms in your layouts</h2>



<p>In design, rhythm is created by simply repeating elements in predictable patterns. This repetition is a natural thing that occurs everywhere in our world. As people, we are driven everyday by predictable, timed events.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://foxiz.themeruby.com/tech/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/12/ts2-1024x576.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-1503" /><figcaption>VR is the use of computer technology to create a simulated environment.</figcaption></figure>



<p>One of the best ways to use <a href="#" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">repetition and rhythm in web design</a> is in the site&#8217;s navigation menu. A consistent, easy-to-follow pattern—in color, layout, etc. Gives users an intuitive roadmap to everything you want to share on your site.</p>



<p>Rhythm also factors into the <strong>layout of content</strong>. For example, you <strong>&#8220;might have&#8221;</strong> blog articles, press releases, and events each follow their own certain layout pattern.</p>



<h2>Elements that can help website visual composition</h2>



<p>Nobody enjoys looking at an ugly web page. Garish colors, cluttered images and distracting animation can all turn customers <strong>&#8220;off&#8221;</strong> and send them shopping<strong> &#8220;somewhere else&#8221;</strong>. Basic composition rules to create more effective:</p>



<ul class="rb-list"><li>Direct the Eye With<strong> </strong><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="#" target="_blank">Leading Lines</a></li><li>Balance Out Your Elements</li><li>Use Elements That<strong> Complement Each Other</strong></li><li>Be clear about your <strong>&#8220;focal points&#8221;</strong> and where you place them</li></ul>



<p>The size and position of elements in a composition will determine its balance. An unbalanced design generates tension, which may be the goal in many design projects, but for web apps that demand repeated comfortable use, tension is not a desirable trait.</p>



<h2>Diving into UX and UI design</h2>



<p><strong>UX and UI: </strong>Two terms that are often used interchangeably, but actually mean very different things. <em>So what exactly is the difference?</em></p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote alignright is-style-default"><blockquote><p>Styles come and go. Good design is a language, not a style.</p><cite>Massimo Vignelli</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>UX design refers to the term <em>“user experience design”</em>, while UI stands for <em>“user interface design</em><strong>”</strong>. Both elements are crucial to a product and work closely together. But despite their relationship, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="#" target="_blank">the roles themselves</a> are quite different.</p>



<h2>Ensure that interactive elements are easy to identify</h2>



<p>Good design guides the user by communicating purpose and priority. For that reason, every part of the design should be based on an <strong>&#8220;<strong>informed decision</strong></strong>&#8221; rather than an arbitrary result of personal taste or the current trend.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="683" src="https://foxiz.themeruby.com/tech/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/12/ts1-1024x683.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-1500" /><figcaption>Network firewalls and security technologies</figcaption></figure>



<p>Provide distinct styles for interactive elements, such as <em>links and buttons</em>, to make them easy to identify. For example, <strong>&#8220;change the appearance of links&#8221;</strong> on mouse hover, &#8220;keyboard focus&#8221;, and &#8220;touch-screen activation&#8221;.</p>



<h2>Breaking down the barriers</h2>



<p><strong>Design is not the end-all solution to all of the worlds problems</strong> — but with the right thinking and application, it can definitely be a good beginning to start tackling them.</p>

<p><strong>Quick and easy access to the content they’re after is more important for your website users than a… visually-stunning design.</strong></p>



<p>Website navigation allows visitors to flow from one page to another without frustration. If you’ve done your job well, visitors leave your site with the <a href="#" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">intention to return</a> and might even buy something from you or sign up for your email list.</p>



<p><em>Bad navigation is an especially common problem. We’ve all struggled to find things on disorganized websites without any logical structure. It feels hopeless.</em></p>



<p>Using <strong>&#8220;complex large pictures&#8221;</strong>. Because a carousel generally carries a lot of picture messages, complex large pictures result in low performance and <strong>&#8220;slow loading rate&#8221;</strong> of the sites, especially those whose first homepages are occupied by high-resolution carousels.</p>



<h2>Creating visual rhythms in your layouts</h2>



<p>In design, rhythm is created by simply repeating elements in predictable patterns. This repetition is a natural thing that occurs everywhere in our world. As people, we are driven everyday by predictable, timed events.</p>

<p>One of the best ways to use <a href="#" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">repetition and rhythm in web design</a> is in the site&#8217;s navigation menu. A consistent, easy-to-follow pattern—in color, layout, etc. Gives users an intuitive roadmap to everything you want to share on your site.</p>



<p>Rhythm also factors into the <strong>layout of content</strong>. For example, you <strong>&#8220;might have&#8221;</strong> blog articles, press releases, and events each follow their own certain layout pattern.</p>



<h2>Elements that can help website visual composition</h2>



<p>Nobody enjoys looking at an ugly web page. Garish colors, cluttered images and distracting animation can all turn customers <strong>&#8220;off&#8221;</strong> and send them shopping<strong> &#8220;somewhere else&#8221;</strong>. Basic composition rules to create more effective:</p>



<ul class="rb-list"><li>Direct the Eye With<strong> </strong><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="#" target="_blank">Leading Lines</a></li><li>Balance Out Your Elements</li><li>Use Elements That<strong> Complement Each Other</strong></li><li>Be clear about your <strong>&#8220;focal points&#8221;</strong> and where you place them</li></ul>



<p>The size and position of elements in a composition will determine its balance. An unbalanced design generates tension, which may be the goal in many design projects, but for web apps that demand repeated comfortable use, tension is not a desirable trait.</p>



<h2>Diving into UX and UI design</h2>



<p><strong>UX and UI: </strong>Two terms that are often used interchangeably, but actually mean very different things. <em>So what exactly is the difference?</em></p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote alignright is-style-default"><blockquote><p>Styles come and go. Good design is a language, not a style.</p><cite>Massimo Vignelli</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>UX design refers to the term <em>“user experience design”</em>, while UI stands for <em>“user interface design</em><strong>”</strong>. Both elements are crucial to a product and work closely together. But despite their relationship, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="#" target="_blank">the roles themselves</a> are quite different.</p>



<h2>Ensure that interactive elements are easy to identify</h2>



<p>Good design guides the user by communicating purpose and priority. For that reason, every part of the design should be based on an <strong>&#8220;<strong>informed decision</strong></strong>&#8221; rather than an arbitrary result of personal taste or the current trend.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="683" src="https://foxiz.themeruby.com/tech/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/12/ts1-1024x683.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-1500" /><figcaption>Network firewalls and security technologies</figcaption></figure>



<p>Provide distinct styles for interactive elements, such as <em>links and buttons</em>, to make them easy to identify. For example, <strong>&#8220;change the appearance of links&#8221;</strong> on mouse hover, &#8220;keyboard focus&#8221;, and &#8220;touch-screen activation&#8221;.</p>



<h2>Breaking down the barriers</h2>



<p><strong>Design is not the end-all solution to all of the worlds problems</strong> — but with the right thinking and application, it can definitely be a good beginning to start tackling them.</p>
