If you\u2019ve done your job well, visitors leave your site with the <a href=\"#\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">intention to return<\/a> and might even buy something from you or sign up for your email list.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Bad navigation is an especially common problem. We\u2019ve all struggled to find things on disorganized websites without any logical structure. It feels hopeless.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Using <strong>&#8220;complex large pictures&#8221;<\/strong>. Because a carousel generally carries a lot of picture messages, complex large pictures result in low performance and <strong>&#8220;slow loading rate&#8221;<\/strong> of the sites, especially those whose first homepages are occupied by high-resolution carousels.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Creating visual rhythms in your layouts<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In design, rhythm is created by simply repeating elements in predictable patterns. This repetition is a natural thing that occurs everywhere in our world. As people, we are driven everyday by predictable, timed events.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" src=\"https:\/\/foxiz.themeruby.com\/tech\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/3\/2021\/12\/ts2-1024x576.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1503\" \/><figcaption>VR is the use of computer technology to create a simulated environment.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the best ways to use <a href=\"#\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">repetition and rhythm in web design<\/a> is in the site&#8217;s navigation menu. A consistent, easy-to-follow pattern\u2014in color, layout, etc. Gives users an intuitive roadmap to everything you want to share on your site.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rhythm also factors into the <strong>layout of content<\/strong>. For example, you <strong>&#8220;might have&#8221;<\/strong> blog articles, press releases, and events each follow their own certain layout pattern.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Elements that can help website visual composition<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Nobody enjoys looking at an ugly web page. Garish colors, cluttered images and distracting animation can all turn customers <strong>&#8220;off&#8221;<\/strong> and send them shopping<strong> &#8220;somewhere else&#8221;<\/strong>. Basic composition rules to create more effective:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"rb-list\"><li>Direct the Eye With<strong> <\/strong><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"#\" target=\"_blank\">Leading Lines<\/a><\/li><li>Balance Out Your Elements<\/li><li>Use Elements That<strong> Complement Each Other<\/strong><\/li><li>Be clear about your <strong>&#8220;focal points&#8221;<\/strong> and where you place them<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The size and position of elements in a composition will determine its balance. An unbalanced design generates tension, which may be the goal in many design projects, but for web apps that demand repeated comfortable use, tension is not a desirable trait.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Diving into UX and UI design<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>UX and UI: <\/strong>Two terms that are often used interchangeably, but actually mean very different things. <em>So what exactly is the difference?<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote alignright is-style-default\"><blockquote><p>Styles come and go. Good design is a language, not a style.<\/p><cite>Massimo Vignelli<\/cite><\/blockquote><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>UX design refers to the term <em>\u201cuser experience design\u201d<\/em>, while UI stands for <em>\u201cuser interface design<\/em><strong>\u201d<\/strong>. Both elements are crucial to a product and work closely together. But despite their relationship, <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"#\" target=\"_blank\">the roles themselves<\/a> are quite different.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Ensure that interactive elements are easy to identify<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Good design guides the user by communicating purpose and priority. For that reason, every part of the design should be based on an <strong>&#8220;<strong>informed decision<\/strong><\/strong>&#8221; rather than an arbitrary result of personal taste or the current trend.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https:\/\/foxiz.themeruby.com\/tech\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/3\/2021\/12\/ts1-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1500\" \/><figcaption>Network firewalls and security technologies<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Provide distinct styles for interactive elements, such as <em>links and buttons<\/em>, to make them easy to identify. For example, <strong>&#8220;change the appearance of links&#8221;<\/strong> on mouse hover, &#8220;keyboard focus&#8221;, and &#8220;touch-screen activation&#8221;.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Breaking down the barriers<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Design is not the end-all solution to all of the worlds problems<\/strong> \u2014 but with the right thinking and application, it can definitely be a good beginning to start tackling them.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good web design has visual weight, is optimized for various devices, and has content that is prioritized for the medium.
